# Modelling-Predator-Prey

# Here, I have used Lotka-Volterra's coupled differential equations to model the change in predator and prey populations over time
# Analysis of the plot: From the assumptions of this mathematical model, the limiting factor of the prey's population is predation by the predator population, and the limiting factor of the predator's population is the competition for food. At any given time, if the prey population is much greater than the predator population, then there are lots of food for the predator population. As a result, the prey population gradually decreases, while the predator population increases. Then, however, the predator population faces competition for food, and the reverse scenario can be observed.
